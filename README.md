## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ussdeveloper/ssh-portal.git
   cd ssh-portal
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage
npm start -- --host <hostname> --user <username> --password <password> [--port <port>]

# Example
npm start -- --host example.com --user admin --password mypassword --port 22
```

### Available Options

- `--host, -h`: SSH hostname or IP address (required)
- `--user, -u`: SSH username (required)
- `--password, -p`: SSH password (required)
- `--port`: SSH port (default: 22)
- `--help`: Show help information

## Scripts

The following npm scripts are available:

- `npm start` - Run the application in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Run the application in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build standalone executable for Windows
- `npm run build:all` - Build executables for all supported platforms
- `npm run clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `npm test` - Run tests (placeholder)

## Building

### Windows Executable

To build a standalone Windows executable:

```bash
npm run build
```

The executable will be generated in the `dist/` directory as `ssh-portal.exe`.

### Multi-platform Build

To build for all supported platforms:

```bash
npm run build:all
```

This will generate executables for:
- Windows (x64)
- Linux (x64)
- macOS (x64)

## Configuration

You can provide connection details in two ways:

1. **CLI Parameters** (recommended for one-time use)
2. **Configuration File** (`src/config-manager.js`)

### Configuration File Format

The configuration manager supports key-value pairs:

```
host=example.com
user=admin
password=changeme
port=22
```

**Security Note:** The default password in configuration is `changeme` - change it before production use!

## AI Assistant & Copilot Integration

> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING FOR AI INTEGRATION ⚠️**
> 
> **EXTREME CAUTION REQUIRED:**
> - AI systems can execute DESTRUCTIVE commands without human oversight
> - NEVER allow AI access to production servers or systems with valuable data
> - AI may misinterpret instructions and execute harmful commands
> - Always use ISOLATED, DISPOSABLE test environments only
> - Monitor ALL AI actions closely and be prepared to interrupt
> - Consider AI actions as POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS and unpredictable
> 
> **ONLY use AI integration in:**
> - Completely isolated virtual machines
> - Docker containers that can be destroyed
> - Local development environments with no important data
> - Test servers that can be rebuilt from scratch
> 
> **You have been warned - proceed with extreme caution!**

SSH Portal is designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants and development copilots, making it an excellent tool for automated server management and deployment tasks **in safe, isolated environments only**.

### 🤖 **AI Agent Integration**

SSH Portal can serve as a **pseudo-SSH-agent** for AI systems, enabling:

- **Automated Deployment** - AI assistants can deploy applications to local or remote servers
- **Server Configuration** - Copilots can configure server settings, install packages, and manage services
- **Infrastructure as Code** - AI can execute infrastructure setup commands and read results
- **Real-time Server Management** - Assistants can monitor, troubleshoot, and maintain server systems

### 🔧 **Use Cases for AI Development**

#### **Local Server Deployment**
```bash
# AI assistant can deploy applications locally
ssh-portal --host localhost --user developer --password mypass "docker-compose up -d"
ssh-portal --host localhost --user developer --password mypass "systemctl restart nginx"
```

#### **Server Configuration Automation**
```bash
# AI can configure server settings
ssh-portal --host server.local --user admin --password pass "apt update && apt install -y nodejs"
ssh-portal --host server.local --user admin --password pass "ufw enable && ufw allow 80,443"
```

#### **Development Environment Setup**
```bash
# Copilot can set up development environments
ssh-portal --host devserver --user dev --password pass "git clone https://github.com/user/project.git"
ssh-portal --host devserver --user dev --password pass "cd project && npm install && npm run build"
```

#### **System Monitoring & Diagnostics**
```bash
# AI can gather system information
ssh-portal --host production --user monitor --password pass "df -h"
ssh-portal --host production --user monitor --password pass "systemctl status nginx"
ssh-portal --host production --user monitor --password pass "tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/error.log"
```

### 🎯 **AI Assistant Benefits**

- **Command Execution with Results** - AI can execute commands and read the output for decision making
- **Multi-Server Management** - Assistants can manage multiple servers simultaneously
- **Error Handling** - AI can detect errors and take corrective actions based on command output
- **Automation Workflows** - Create complex deployment and configuration workflows
- **Testing Scenarios** - Perfect for testing deployment scripts and server configurations

### 📋 **Integration Examples**

#### **Copilot Server Setup Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Check server status
ssh-portal --host newserver --user root --password pass "uptime && free -h"

# 2. Install required software
ssh-portal --host newserver --user root --password pass "apt update"
ssh-portal --host newserver --user root --password pass "apt install -y docker.io nginx"

# 3. Configure services
ssh-portal --host newserver --user root --password pass "systemctl enable docker nginx"
ssh-portal --host newserver --user root --password pass "systemctl start docker nginx"

# 4. Deploy application
ssh-portal --transfer app.tar.gz /opt/
ssh-portal --host newserver --user root --password pass "cd /opt && tar -xzf app.tar.gz"
```

#### **AI-Driven Troubleshooting**
```bash
# AI can diagnose issues step by step
ssh-portal --host problematic-server --user admin --password pass "systemctl status apache2"
ssh-portal --host problematic-server --user admin --password pass "tail -n 100 /var/log/apache2/error.log"
ssh-portal --host problematic-server --user admin --password pass "netstat -tlnp | grep :80"
```

### 🔒 **Security for AI Integration**

> **MANDATORY SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:**
> - **NEVER use on production systems** - AI can cause irreversible damage
> - **Test environments ONLY** - Use disposable VMs or containers
> - **Human supervision REQUIRED** - Never let AI run unsupervised
> - **Backup everything** - Assume AI will break things

- **Isolated Testing** - Use ONLY for development and testing environments
- **Limited Privileges** - Create dedicated users with minimal required permissions
- **Session Logging** - Use `--log` option to track all AI-executed commands
- **Configuration Management** - Store connection details in config files for consistency
- **Immediate Termination** - Be ready to kill processes if AI goes wrong

### 💡 **Best Practices for AI Usage**

> **CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:**
> - **ASSUME AI WILL MAKE MISTAKES** - Plan for disaster recovery
> - **NEVER trust AI completely** - Verify every critical operation
> - **USE ONLY DISPOSABLE SYSTEMS** - Nothing you can't afford to lose

1. **Validate Commands** - AI should verify command syntax before execution
2. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error checking and recovery mechanisms  
3. **Logging** - Always log AI interactions for debugging and audit purposes
4. **Incremental Deployment** - Break complex tasks into smaller, verifiable steps
5. **Rollback Procedures** - Have rollback commands ready for critical operations
6. **Human Oversight** - NEVER let AI operate completely autonomously
7. **Backup Strategy** - Backup everything before AI operations
8. **Kill Switch** - Have immediate way to stop AI operations
